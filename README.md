# Challenge Xalantis

## Project Description

This project was developed as part of the challenge proposed by Xalantis. The objective is to create a React Native and Expo application that includes authentication and displays lists of Pokémon and Mercedes-Benz cars, using a public API to fetch the data.

## Project Setup

### Prerequisites

- Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your machine.
- You will also need to have [Git](https://git-scm.com/) installed.

### Steps

1. Clone the repository to your local environment:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/doebber28/challenge-xalantis.git
   
2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd challenge-xalantis

3. Install project dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   
4. Start the project with Expo:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   This command will start the application and open a page in your web browser with a QR code that you can scan using the Expo Go app on your mobile device.

5. Scan the QR code with the Expo Go app on your mobile device to view the application in real time.

   Login Credentials
   To authenticate in the application, use the following credentials:

   Email: pablodoebber28@gmail.com
   Password: 123456

Notes
   Please make sure your machine is connected to the internet, as the application may need to access external resources to load Pokémon and Mercedes-Benz car data.
